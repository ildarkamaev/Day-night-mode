# Webpage with day/night mode

Web page with day mode and night mode

## WTF is this?

Based on Gary Simons video [Creating a Dark & Light Toggle Mode on your UI Designs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKXv_ZHQ654) 
I built a webpage with switchable day and night modes using HTML, CSS and bit of JS.

## What was used
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS
* JS

## What I learned
* How to make a switch using pure CSS
* You can create custom Data attributes in HTML and use them in CSS and JS
* How to toggle between themes using JS
* That there is shorthand for font properties in CSS

## Problems/Mistakes
* No real problems

## License

Pretty much use it however you like.
