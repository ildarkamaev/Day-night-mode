# Webpage with day/night mode

Web page with day mode and night mode

## WTF is this?

Based on Gary Simons video [SMOOTH SCROLLING with Jump.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwNGfJu-T2k&t=487s) 
I built a webpage with smooth scrolling using Jump.js

## What was used
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS
* JS

## What I learned
* How to install scripts and packages using npm install
* How to implement jump.js and customize it

## Problems/Mistakes
* 

## License

Pretty much use it however you like.
